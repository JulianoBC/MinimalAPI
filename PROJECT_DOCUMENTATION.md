# Project Documentation: PersonalKnowledgeBase

## 1. Project Overview and Goals

**Project Name:** PersonalKnowledgeBase (formerly memorybank)

**Project Goal:** To develop a personal knowledge management system that allows users to efficiently capture, organize, and retrieve notes, ideas, and information. This system will be built using a Minimal API backend for data management and an AstroJS frontend for a user-friendly interface.

**Key Features:**

*   **Note Creation and Editing:** Users can create, edit, and delete notes with rich text formatting.
*   **Categorization and Tagging:** Notes can be categorized and tagged for easy organization and retrieval.
*   **Search Functionality:** Robust search capabilities to quickly find notes based on keywords, tags, or categories.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive and responsive frontend built with AstroJS for a seamless user experience.
*   **Scalable Backend:** A Minimal API backend designed for performance and scalability to handle a growing number of notes and users.

## 2. Technology Stack

**Backend:**

*   **Language:** C# (.NET 8 Minimal API)
*   **Framework:** .NET Minimal API
*   **Database:** (To be decided - e.g., SQLite for simplicity, PostgreSQL or MySQL for scalability)
*   **API Style:** RESTful API

**Frontend:**

*   **Framework:** AstroJS
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** CSS (or Tailwind CSS, utility-first CSS framework)
*   **Bundler:** Vite (integrated with AstroJS)

## 3. System Architecture

**3.1. Backend Architecture (Minimal API)**

The backend will be built using .NET 8 Minimal API, focusing on simplicity and performance. It will expose RESTful API endpoints to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for notes and related entities (categories, tags).

**API Endpoints (Example):**

*   `GET /api/notes`: Retrieve all notes (with optional filtering and pagination).
*   `GET /api/notes/{id}`: Retrieve a specific note by ID.
*   `POST /api/notes`: Create a new note.
*   `PUT /api/notes/{id}`: Update an existing note.
*   `DELETE /api/notes/{id}`: Delete a note.
*   `GET /api/categories`: Retrieve all categories.
*   `GET /api/tags`: Retrieve all tags.

**3.2. Frontend Architecture (AstroJS)**

The frontend will be developed using AstroJS, leveraging its performance and component-based architecture to create a fast and user-friendly interface.

*   **Components:** Astro components will be used to build reusable UI elements for note display, editing forms, navigation, etc.
*   **Routing:** Astro's file-based routing will be used to manage different views (e.g., note list, note detail, settings).
*   **Data Fetching:**  `fetch` API will be used to communicate with the Minimal API backend to retrieve and manipulate note data.
*   **State Management:** (Simple state management within Astro components or consider a lightweight library like nanostores if needed).

**3.3. Backend and Frontend Interaction**

The AstroJS frontend will communicate with the Minimal API backend via HTTP requests to the defined API endpoints. Data will be exchanged in JSON format.

1.  **Frontend Request:** User actions in the frontend (e.g., creating a note, searching) trigger HTTP requests to the backend API.
2.  **Backend Processing:** The Minimal API backend receives the request, processes it (e.g., interacts with the database), and returns a JSON response.
3.  **Frontend Update:** The AstroJS frontend receives the JSON response and updates the UI accordingly to reflect the changes.

## 4. Development Setup Instructions

**4.1. Backend Development Setup (.NET Minimal API)**

1.  **Install .NET 8 SDK:** Download and install the .NET 8 SDK from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0).
2.  **Install a suitable IDE or Code Editor:** (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with C# extension, JetBrains Rider).
3.  **Create Backend Project:**
    ```bash
    dotnet new webapi -o PersonalKnowledgeBase.Backend
    cd PersonalKnowledgeBase.Backend
    ```
4.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Choose a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    *   Configure database connection string in `appsettings.json`.
    *   Install necessary database provider NuGet packages (e.g., `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite`).
    *   Set up Entity Framework Core (or Dapper, or other ORM/data access method) for database interactions.
5.  **Run the Backend:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    The backend API will be accessible at `https://localhost:{port}` (port number will be displayed in the console).

**4.2. Frontend Development Setup (AstroJS)**

1.  **Install Node.js and npm:** Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Create Frontend Project:**
    ```bash
    npm create astro@latest PersonalKnowledgeBase.Frontend
    cd PersonalKnowledgeBase.Frontend
    ```
    Follow the AstroJS project setup prompts (choose "empty" or "minimal" template, TypeScript, etc.).
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:4321`.

**4.3. Running Backend and Frontend Together**

1.  **Start the Backend:** In one terminal, navigate to the `PersonalKnowledgeBase.Backend` directory and run `dotnet run`.
2.  **Start the Frontend:** In another terminal, navigate to the `PersonalKnowledgeBase.Frontend` directory and run `npm run dev`.
3.  **Access the Application:** Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4321` to access the frontend. Ensure the frontend is configured to point to the correct backend API URL (e.g., `https://localhost:{backend-port}/api`).

## 5. Future Development Considerations and Scalability

**5.1. Future Features:**

*   **Advanced Search:** Implement full-text search capabilities.
*   **Markdown Support:** Enhance note editing with full Markdown support.
*   **Image and File Attachments:** Allow users to attach images and files to notes.
*   **Collaboration Features:** Enable sharing notes and collaboration with other users.
*   **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the frontend is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices.
*   **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implement user accounts and secure access to personal knowledge bases.
*   **Data Backup and Export:** Provide options for users to backup and export their notes.
*   **Plugins/Extensions:** Allow for extending functionality through plugins or extensions.

**5.2. Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Database Choice:** Select a database that can scale effectively (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, cloud-based database services) if expecting a large number of notes or users.
*   **Backend Performance:** Optimize backend API endpoints for performance and consider caching strategies.
*   **Frontend Optimization:** Optimize frontend assets and code for fast loading times and efficient rendering.
*   **Deployment Architecture:** Consider a scalable deployment architecture (e.g., containerization with Docker, cloud deployment on platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud).
*   **Load Balancing:** Implement load balancing for the backend API if needed to handle high traffic.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring and logging to track performance and identify potential issues as the system scales.
